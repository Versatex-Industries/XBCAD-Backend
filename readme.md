EduTrack360 Backend API
The EduTrack360 backend API is a Node.js-based Express application using MongoDB as the database. The API powers the EduTrack360 app, providing real-time bus tracking, donation management, community engagement, and educational/health resources.

Features
User Authentication: JWT-based user registration and login.
Bus Tracking: Real-time tracking of school buses, check-in system for students.
Donation Management: Manage donation campaigns and track user contributions.
Community Engagement: Volunteer opportunities, secure messaging, and event management.
Educational and Health Resources: Access to downloadable educational content and health tracking features.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend runtime.
Express.js: Web framework for building the API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for data storage.
Mongoose: ODM for MongoDB to manage database schema.
JWT: JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
Bcrypt: Used for password hashing.
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v12.x or higher)
MongoDB (Ensure MongoDB is running locally or on a remote server)
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
   bash
   Copy code
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/edutrack360-api.git
   cd edutrack360-api
2. Install Dependencies
   Install all the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Configure MongoDB Connection
   Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine or a cloud provider (such as MongoDB Atlas). If using MongoDB locally, no changes are required. If you're using a remote MongoDB instance, modify the connection string in server.js:

javascript
Copy code
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/edutrack360', {
useNewUrlParser: true,
useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
Update the URI to point to your MongoDB instance if necessary.

4. Set Environment Variables
   Create a .env file in the root of the project and define the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET: Replace your_secret_key with a secure random key used for JWT token signing.
5. Run the Application
   To start the Express server, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The API should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

7. Testing the API
   You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Make requests to the various endpoints while passing the required headers and body parameters as described in the API documentation.

8. Troubleshooting
   If you run into any issues:

Make sure MongoDB is running: Check if your MongoDB server is running on the correct port (usually 27017).
Verify your .env file has the correct configuration.
Check the logs in the terminal for any error messages.
Future Enhancements
Implement real-time notifications with WebSockets.
Add support for different user roles (admin, teacher, parent) with specific permissions.
Improve donation tracking and add analytics features.
